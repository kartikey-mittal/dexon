## ⚠️ Why DEXON?

😢 Most never speak up.  
💡 *DEXON listens — even when they can’t speak.*

### 📉 The Crisis

- **76.5%** of verbal abuse cases come from within the home.
- Long-term mental health costs exceed **$300 billion/year**.
- Emotional disconnect between guardians and children continues to grow.
